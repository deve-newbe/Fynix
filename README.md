# Fynx
ELF/DWARF Visualizer and off-line calibration tool

This application is able to process .elf files containing both ELF and DWARF information. It is aimed at cross-compiled binaries for microcontrollers.

The tool allows to offline calibrate the .hex binaries. In a nutshell, off-line calibration allows for changes in behaviour of the code by adjusting symbol values without the need to recompile.
